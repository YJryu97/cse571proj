This project explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for autonomous robot local navigation. Specifically, comparing the performance of Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) algorithms in developing a local navigation policy for a differential-drive mobile robot 
equipped with a LiDAR sensor. Implementation of DRL robot navigation based on https://github.com/reiniscimurs/DRL-robot-navigation
